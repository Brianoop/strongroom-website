            <p class="answer">
              You can download the mobile application from the company website.
              Later on, the mobile application will be published on Google
              Playstore.
            </p>
          </div>


          <div>
            <p class="question">3.	How much will I be required to pay for the mobile application?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              Nothing at all! The Strongroom mobile application is totally free for download and use. However, Terms and Conditions apply to the use of the mobile application. Make sure you go through our Privacy.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">4.	Will I be able to make payments through the mobile app?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              We did not enable the ability to make payments using the first version of the mobile application because it is in the testing phase and so our dear clients will have to keep on making payments using the cash at hand method and Mobile Money or Bank Account.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">5.	Is our personal data secure on your platform?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              Yes. We do not share our user data with other third parties or partners since we value the privacy of our user data. We also use encryption to store user passwords as an added security measure to protect our users in these modern times.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">6.	How can we send our complaints to your office through the mobile app?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              The Strongroom mobile app has a feedback feature that allows a user to type any feedback and send to the Strongroom systems where our systems administrators read through the feedback to make better decisions and improve on the product for a better user experience with our application.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">7.	Do I need an Internet connection to be able to use the mobile application? </p>
            <p class="answer">
              Yes you do. Our mobile application uses Internet Connection to get information about machines from our online systems. It also uses Internet to send data such as booking requests and feedback, login and registration data to our online system. In case you are not connected to the Internet, a No Internet Connection alert dialog will be displayed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">8.	How much mobile broadband data does the mobile application need in order to make a booking request for a machine? </p>
            <p class="answer">
              The mobile application typically has no heavy resources that are loaded from the Internet such as videos or unnecessary files. The images of the machines that are displayed in the mobile application are cached so that they are loaded only once and the next time the same image needs to be loaded, it’s fetched from the cache. This feature only works if a user does not clear the mobile application’s cache. Therefore, a user typically needs under 2MB to be able to make a booking request with our mobile application.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">9.	How do I know that my booking request has been processed?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              Once your booking request has been successfully sent to our servers, our systems administrators will analyze the request and either approve or disapprove the request. After this, the user who sent the booking request will receive a notification on the mobile application. This user will also be able to see their booking request under the ‘Bookings’ feature of the mobile application.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">10.	Will a user be able to cancel a booking request in case of an error made during the booking process?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              Yes. The mobile application has a feature that allows a user to cancel the Booking Request through the app. A user may alternatively decide to call the office and directly request for their booking request to be cancelled.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">11.	How can we report app crashes and bugs in the app?</p>

            <p class="question">13.	Is Strongroom a Giant Pool Group product?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              Yes. Strongroom was developed by the software engineers at Giant Pool Group to aid in the booking process of machines by clients and also to avail real-time information about the statuses of the machines in the office.

          <div>
            <p class="question">14.	Is there a limit to the number of booking requests I can make using the mobile application?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              No. There is no limit to the number of booking requests that a user can make using the mobile application. However, a single machine can either be booked twice for half-day use or once for full-day use in a day. This applies to single receiver machines. Full set machines can only be booked once a day for full day use.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">15.	What Technologies power the Strongroom mobile application?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              The Strongroom mobile application is powered by Flutter 2.5. Flutter is a mobile Software Development Kit developed by Google for building cross platform mobile applications for Android and IOS platforms.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="question">16.	Is there an iOS version of the app?</p>
            <p class="answer">
              We are working very hard to avail the IOS version of the app on the App Store. Since we used a cross platform mobile SDK for developing our app, there is already an IOS version although we have not yet uploaded it to Apple’s App Store. We are hoping to avail this version soon. Please use the Android version in the meanwhile.
